\section{Introduction}
Ensemble learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that combines the predictions of multiple base models to improve overall performance. Bagging and boosting are two widely used ensemble methods that address different aspects of the problem. In this assignment, we will explain the concepts of bagging and boosting, provide examples to illustrate their application, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Bagging}
Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble learning method that aims to reduce variance and enhance the stability of predictions. It involves training multiple instances of the same base model on different subsets of the training data, obtained through bootstrap sampling (random sampling with replacement).

\subsection{Bagging Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly select $n$ subsets (bags) with replacement from the training dataset.
    \item Train the base model on each subset independently.
    \item Aggregate predictions from each model to make the final prediction (e.g., majority voting for classification or averaging for regression).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example: Random Forest}
Random Forest is a popular ensemble method based on bagging, utilizing decision trees as base models. Each decision tree is trained on a different random subset of features and data points. The final prediction is the majority vote of all the decision trees.



\section{Boosting}
Boosting is an iterative ensemble learning technique that focuses on improving the accuracy of weak base models by giving more weight to misclassified instances. It trains a sequence of base models, and each model tries to correct the errors made by its predecessor.

\subsection{Boosting Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assign equal weights to all training instances initially.
    \item Train the base model on the weighted training data.
    \item Increase the weights of misclassified instances to emphasize them in the next iteration.
    \item Repeat the process for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.
    \item Aggregate predictions from all models using a weighted average.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)}
AdaBoost is a widely used boosting algorithm that works well with binary classification problems. It iteratively updates the weights of training instances to give more emphasis to misclassified examples. Weak learners, such as decision stumps (shallow decision trees), are combined to create a strong learner.



\section{Comparison of Bagging and Boosting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bagging aims to reduce variance and avoid overfitting, whereas boosting focuses on improving accuracy by iteratively adjusting the model's emphasis on misclassified instances.
    \item Bagging trains base models independently, while boosting trains models sequentially, adjusting the weights of instances at each iteration.
    \item Bagging can benefit from parallel processing as each model is independent, while boosting is inherently sequential.
\end{itemize}

\section{Advantages and Disadvantages}
\subsection{Bagging}
\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduces variance and overfitting.
    \item Can be parallelized, leading to faster training.
    \item Suitable for high-dimensional data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Might not improve performance with strong base models.
    \item Does not correct the bias of weak learners.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boosting}
\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improves the performance of weak learners significantly.
    \item Can be used with various base models.
    \item Reduces bias and increases accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.
    \item Slower training due to the sequential nature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Bagging and boosting are both powerful ensemble learning techniques that can significantly improve model performance. Bagging focuses on reducing variance and improving stability, while boosting emphasizes increasing accuracy by sequentially adjusting the model's weights. The choice between bagging and boosting depends on the specific problem and data characteristics.
